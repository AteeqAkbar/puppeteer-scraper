The Business Corporations Act (BCA) sets out the legislative requirements and mechanisms for a business to incorporate in Alberta and maintain that corporation, including, but not limited to, changing its corporate name, filing annual returns, and changing directors and shareholders of that corporation. Corporate Registry of Service Alberta can find information on the certificates and history of Alberta societies, non-profit organization, trade names, limited liability partnerships and corporations; registration services include registrations, revivals, name changes, and amendments. There are several ways to set up the legal structure of the business or non-profit organization.</p> <ul><li>Alberta corporations: Incorporating a corporation creates a legal person that's separate and distinct from its individual owners.</li> <li>Out-of-province corporations: A corporation formed in another province or country must be registered to carry on business in Alberta.</li> <li>Non-profit companies: Organizations can choose to incorporate a non-profit company when they want a legal structure that is similar to the structure of a for-profit corporation.</li> <li>Religious societies: Religious organizations and congregations can incorporate so they can own the land where their house of worship or cemetery is located.</li> <li>Societies: Similar to non-profit companies, organizations can incorporate a society for social, recreational and other useful purposes, but not for carrying on a business.</li> <li>Alberta-based cooperatives: A cooperative is a business organization started by people who want to use services or buy goods as a group, have an equal say in how the business is run and share in any profits the business makes.</li> <li>Out-of-province cooperatives: Out-of-province cooperatives operate like Alberta-based cooperatives, but have a different process in place for incorporation.</li> </ul> <p>Information about Alberta corporations is public information, including a corporation's registered office address, as required by corporate laws that govern corporations. This applies even after a corporation has been dissolved, amalgamated or discontinued. Corporate information is made public to help people, like investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders, make timely and informed decisions about corporations, and let people know who is responsible for the corporation. Information and documents filed are not removed from the corporate records even when new information or documents are filed, including documents previously filed, filed for previous years or filed by mistake. Corporate laws require the public disclosure of this information.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

In Coquitlam, licences are valid for one year from the date of commencement of the business.</p> <p>The first step of starting a commercial or industrial business is confirming that the location is zoned for business use. Applications for Coquitlam businesses are based on the types of the businesses: Commercial/Industrial, Home Based Business, Non-Resident, Special Event Vending. Depending on the type of business operating in Coquitlam, other permits or licences may be required that are not regulated by the City. Depending on the business type, there are often provincial or federal regulators. Examples of these include liquor licences and health permits. </p> <p>A short-term rental is defined as the rental and occupation of a sleeping unit which is attached to or part of a dwelling unit, either with common cooking facilities, or where regular meals are provided. City of Coquitlam has specific regulations for short-term rentals to ensure the rental does not negatively impact a residential neighbourhood. The Tri Cities Intermunicipal Business Licence program allows mobile businesses based in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam or Port Moody to obtain an add-on business licence and operate legally in all three Tri Cities municipalities. Non-resident businesses based in other municipalities must still obtain non-resident business licences to operate in each Tri Cities municipality. A mobile business is a business that has a location, shop, office, or home -base in either Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam or Port Moody and delivers its services by moving from client to client throughout the Tri Cities. The principal municipality is the community in which the business has its location, shop, office or home base.</p> <p>This dataset identifies current licensed businesses and trades. The following information are included: business name, licence type and subtype, licence status, license issue date and application date, business type, business location, telephone, and others.</p> <p>The Open Data Portal of Coquitlam is available to everyone without restrictions with the goal of empowering citizens, helping small businesses, supporting the development community and enhancing service delivery. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

The property assessment notice provides basic profile information about a property. A Property Account Number (PAN) is assigned to your property to identify it for assessment and taxation purposes. A Parcel Identification Number (PID) is assigned to your property to locate it on maps. </p> <p>Each year, property assessors investigate and analyze all real estate sales and exclude sales that do not meet various criteria from any adjustments. While some homes this year have been selling well above the asking price, one sale does not make a market. Assessors are qualified individuals that use appraisal industry best practices in determining real and true (market) value of all properties. The Assessment for Taxation is the value used for calculating your property tax levy. This amount reflects any reduction made to the Real Property Assessment value to provide tax relief, including: (1) Assessment Spike Protection: Owner-occupied properties are protected from unexpected assessment spikes. Any increase greater than 10% will be phased in over time, making assessment growth much more stable and predictable. Properties that have sold in the previous year and all new construction and/or major improvements are excluded from this protection; (2) Assessment Reduction Program: Depending on the use of the property, charitable or not-for-profit organizations can get a reduction in the value of the property - resulting in a lower property tax bill.</p> <p>This dataset includes property valuation and taxation information for New Brunswick. Each property is registered with property account number, parcel identifier, property type, property location, assessed value, tax levy, etc.</p> <p>The Province of New Brunswick is committed to supporting citizen engagement and enhancing transparency and accountability to its residents by providing public access to its data.
