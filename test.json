In Coquitlam, licences are valid for one year from the date of commencement of the business.</p> <p>The first step of starting a commercial or industrial business is confirming that the location is zoned for business use. Applications for Coquitlam businesses are based on the types of the businesses: Commercial/Industrial, Home Based Business, Non-Resident, Special Event Vending.

City of Coquitlam has specific regulations for short-term rentals to ensure the rental does not negatively impact a residential neighbourhood. The Tri Cities Intermunicipal Business Licence program allows mobile businesses based in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam or Port Moody to obtain an add-on business licence and operate legally in all three Tri Cities municipalities. Non-resident businesses based in other municipalities must still obtain non-resident business licences to operate in each Tri Cities municipality. A mobile business is a business that has a location, shop, office, or home -base in either Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam or Port Moody and delivers its services by moving from client to client throughout the Tri Cities. The principal municipality is the community in which the business has its location, shop, office or home base.</p> <p>This dataset identifies current licensed businesses and trades. The following information are included: business name, licence type and subtype, licence status, license issue date and application date, business type, business location, telephone, and others.</p> <p>The Open Data Portal of Coquitlam is available to everyone without restrictions with the goal of empowering citizens, helping small businesses, supporting the development community and enhancing service delivery. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

The property assessment notice provides basic profile information about a property. A Property Account Number (PAN) is assigned to your property to identify it for assessment and taxation purposes. A Parcel Identification Number (PID) is assigned to your property to locate it on maps. </p> <p>Each year, property assessors investigate and analyze all real estate sales and exclude sales that do not meet various criteria from any adjustments. While some homes this year have been selling well above the asking price, one sale does not make a market. Assessors are qualified individuals that use appraisal industry best practices in determining real and true (market) value of all properties. The Assessment for Taxation is the value used for calculating your property tax levy. This amount reflects any reduction made to the Real Property Assessment value to provide tax relief, including: (1) Assessment Spike Protection: Owner-occupied properties are protected from unexpected assessment spikes. Any increase greater than 10% will be phased in over time, making assessment growth much more stable and predictable. Properties that have sold in the previous year and all new construction and/or major improvements are excluded from this protection; (2) Assessment Reduction Program: Depending on the use of the property, charitable or not-for-profit organizations can get a reduction in the value of the property - resulting in a lower property tax bill.</p> <p>This dataset includes property valuation and taxation information for New Brunswick. Each property is registered with property account number, parcel identifier, property type, property location, assessed value, tax levy, etc.</p> <p>The Province of New Brunswick is committed to supporting citizen engagement and enhancing transparency and accountability to its residents by providing public access to its data.
